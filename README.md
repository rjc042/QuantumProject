# QuantumProject

This project uses the four Python scripts found in this directory to generate dynamics of the quantum system.

initialize.py contains methods necessary to instantiate both static and dynamic quantities prior to time-evolving the system.

setupplots.py contains methods to initialize plots with appropriate labels.

evolve.py contains calculations necessary to evolve the system through time, in both position and momentum space.

The dynamics of the quantum system are generated and visualized via the quantum-well.py file.
This script utilizes three modules found in the repository.
